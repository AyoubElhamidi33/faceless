1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
Did you know that Flight 19's radio transmissions

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,120
mysteriously transformed into eerie, unearthly static?

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,720
On December 5, 1945, off the Florida coast,

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,320
five naval bombers known as Flight 19

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,359
vanished without a trace.

6
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:17,000
The squadron's radio transmissions

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,440
rapidly shifted from normal communication

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,280
to strange, indecipherable static.

9
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,199
As the planes flew deeper into the Bermuda Triangle,

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,320
confusion was replaced by an unsettling silence.

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,600
Rescue missions launched to find the missing jets

12
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,240
suffered similar fates.

13
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,840
Weather patterns shifted abruptly, compasses spun wildly,

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,520
and experienced navigators were drawn off course,

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,240
vanishing as mysteriously as the planes they pursued.

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,320
Flight 19's fate remains an enigma, silent and unresolved.
