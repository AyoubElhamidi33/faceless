  "script_text": "Did you know that Flight 19's radio transmissions mysteriously transformed into eerie, unearthly static? On December 5th, 1945, off the Florida coast, five naval bombers known as Flight 19 vanished without a trace. The squadron's radio transmissions rapidly shifted from normal communication to strange, indecipherable static. As the planes flew deeper into the Bermuda Triangle, confusion was replaced by an unsettling silence. Rescue missions launched to find the missing jets suffered similar fates\u2014weather patterns shifted abruptly, compasses spun wildly, and experienced navigators were drawn off course, vanishing as mysteriously as the planes they pursued. Flight 19's fate remains an enigma\u2014silent and unresolved.",
