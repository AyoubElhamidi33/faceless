00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
Did you know that the missing Flight 19 reappears intact, year after year?

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,679
On December 5, 1945, five TBM Avenger torpedo bombers vanished over the Bermuda Triangle,

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,919
never to be seen until strange appearances began to occur.

4
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:19,839
Decades later, reports emerged of an intact Flight 19 suddenly appearing in remote

5
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:24,080
airstrips across the globe, briefly, eerily intact.

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,480
Each year, various locations from Argentina to Alaska report unconfirmed sightings

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,200
of these aircraft gliding through ghostly fogs, herald in calamity.

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,960
Authorities find nothing, leaving only chilled witnesses.

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,640
The pattern continues, leaving investigators puzzled as the planes

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,960
vanished just as they appeared, leaving behind only questions.
