  "script_text": "Did you know that in 1945, Flight 19 mysteriously vanished, leaving behind haunting transmissions? On December 5th, 1945, off the coast of Florida, a squadron of five TBM Avenger torpedo bombers, known as Flight 19, embarked on a routine training mission. As they flew deeper into the Bermuda Triangle, their leader, Charles Taylor, began sending increasingly disturbing radio messages. With compass and maps malfunctioning, the squadron was hopelessly lost. As night fell, radio contact became erratic and filled with static. A rescue plane was dispatched but it too disappeared, never to be heard from again. Despite an extensive search, neither wreckage nor bodies were ever found. The incident remains shrouded in mystery, fueling countless theories. What really happened remains unsolved.",
