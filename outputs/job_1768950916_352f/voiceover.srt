1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
Did you know that in 1945, Flight 19 mysteriously vanished,

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,400
leaving behind haunting transmissions?

3
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,279
On December 5th, 1945, off the coast of Florida,

4
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:14,560
a squadron of five TBM Avenger torpedo bombers,

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,960
known as Flight 19,

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,480
embarked on a routine training mission.

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,920
As they flew deeper into the Bermuda Triangle,

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,400
their leader, Charles Taylor,

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,160
began sending increasingly disturbing radio messages.

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,359
With compass and maps malfunctioning,

11
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:30,839
the squadron was hopelessly lost.

12
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:33,560
As night fell, radio contact became erratic

13
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,320
and filled with static.

14
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,439
A rescue plane was dispatched, but it too disappeared,

15
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:40,480
never to be heard from again.

16
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,159
Despite an extensive search,

17
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,039
neither wreckage nor bodies were ever found.

18
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,239
The incident remains shrouded in mystery,

19
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:48,920
fueling countless theories.

20
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,439
What really happened remains unsolved.
